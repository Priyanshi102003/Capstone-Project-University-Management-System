# Capstone-Project-University-Management-System
University Management System
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates the design, normalization, and optimization of a University Management System database. The database is systematically converted from Unnormalized Form (UNF) to First, Second, and Third Normal Forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF) to minimize redundancy and ensure data integrity. The final database is implemented using MySQL following standard relational design principles.

🎯Objectives

Understand database normalization concepts (UNF → 1NF → 2NF → 3NF)

Reduce data redundancy and improve efficiency

Design an optimized relational database schema

Implement the normalized database using MySQL

🛠️ Technologies Used
